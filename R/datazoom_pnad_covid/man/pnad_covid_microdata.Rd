\description{
Extracts and builds databases from the PNAD COVID19 survey in R format (.RData) from
the original microdata - for information on how to get the original data files, check IBGE's website -
www.ibge.gov.br .
Since the survey is still being published by IBGE,
this function is subject to frequent updates.
The function generates a database per month of the survey. If it is the case, use
the \code{\link{dplyr::bind_rows}} command to stack all data.
